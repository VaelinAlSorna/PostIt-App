# PostIt-App

The fully functional and fully responsive website which I built with React, Redux, React Router, Sass and Webpack.And I also wrote tests for this app with Jest.
On this website you can post, remove, update articles. You can also view articles of other users and comment or like them.
You can view this website online here: https://postit-right-now.herokuapp.com/

### Installing
```
install dependencies:
    yarn install
```

### Using app on locak development server
```
yarn dev-server
```
Note that this app makes http requests to PostIt-API which you can also find in my repository. So for this app to work you need to run it simultaneously with PostIt-API.

## Running the tests

yarn test
